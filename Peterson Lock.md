##### (wrong) implementation example from Lecture 15 #Slides-Lecture-15:
![[bad Peterson lock in Java.png]]
code incorrect tho because the entire boolean array is marked as volatile, whereas the correct approach would be to make the elements **AtomicIntegers** and the array an **AtomicIntegerArray**

#TODO *: why AtomicIntegerArray and not AtomicBoolean[]? (internet suggests the latter is faster) Also, find the proper implementation from lecture*

*From TA slides:*
