- **Parallelism**: Execution truly in parallel (on the hardware level)
- **Concurrency**: Multiple Threads for example may be executed on the same physical hardware, but which one is currently executed can be switched (Multiplexing)`

## Parallelism on the Hardware
### Vectorization
Modern CPUs support Vector operations. *SIMD* (Single Instruction Multiple Data)
### Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP)
#TODO

### Pipelining
See DDCA.
