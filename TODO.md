What is already covered in detail:
#Slides-Lecture-16 #Slides-Lecture-17 #Slides-Lecture-18 #Slides-Lecture-19 #Slides-Lecture-20 #Slides-Lecture-21 #Slides-Lecture-22  #Slides-Lecture-23 #Slides-Lecture-24 #Slides-Lecture-25 #Slides-Lecture-26 #Slides-Lecture-27

- [ ] **TODO**: RE MARK #Slides-Lecture TAGS (due to the slides containing a lot more material than just the single lecture they were used in, a lot of the markers now refer in part to earlier lectures than they should. Use the **trimmed** versions of the slides whenever possible, otherwise check the adjacent lectures for **trimmed** versions)
