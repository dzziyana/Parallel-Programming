**(minimale) Garantien (/definitions) wie JVM mit der Memory-Hardware interagiert**
#### volatile fields
1.  compiler **MUST NOT** reorder/delete (see [[Memory Reording]])
1.  caches must IMMEDIATELY write to main memory
##### example:
```java
class C {
	private int x = 0;
	private int y = 0;
	void f() {
	//Thread 1
		x = 1;
		y = 1;
	}
	void g() {
	//Thread 2
		int a = y;
		int b = x;
		assert(b >= a);
	}
}
```
Kein [[Races#- BadInterleaving aka [High Level Race Condition] , high semantic level|bad interleaving]] möglich für assert, aber falls $T_{1}$ und  $T_{2}$ auf unterschiedlichen Cores laufen...
- **x = 1, y = 1** im Cache vom Core von $T_1$
- **y = 1** im Main Memory, $T_2$ kopiert in eigenen Cache
- $T_2$ liest vom eigenen Cache $\rightarrow$ **y = 1 & x = 0** $\rightarrow$ **a = 1 & b = 0**
- **x = 1** im Main Memory, $T_2$ kopiert in eigenen Cache
- > *oopsie*
**FIX?**: Make `x` and `y` volatile.
$\Rightarrow$ accesses  are not strictly atomic (*Lecture 18 pt 2*)

#### in volatile fields
... accesses don't count as data races
... slower than regular fields, faster than locks
**... rather don't use them**
f.e. used in a ***turn*** variable context where else the different threads would have different views on the state of the variable => atomic

#### more realistic example (code incorrect)
```java
class C {
	boolean stop = false;
	void f() {
		while(!stop) {
		// draw a monster
		}
	}
	void g() {
		stop = didUserQuit();
	}
}
```

## Executions
*Executions* combine *actions* with *ordering*:
+ Program Order
+ Synchronizes-With
+ Synchronization Order
+ Happens-before
## JMM : Program Order
> [!Definition] 
> Program Order is a total order of intra-thread (not between threads) actions., does not provide an ordering guarantee for memory accesses. 
 > 
 > **Intra**-thread consistency: **Per thread**, the PO's order is consistent with the thread's isolated execution.

## Synchronization Actions (SA) & Synchronization Order (SO)
### SAs are...
- **read/write** of a **volatile** variable
- un/lock monitor
- **first/last** action of a thread (synthetic)
- actions which **start a thread**
- actions which determine **whether a thread has terminated**

> **SAs form the SO**
### SO
- is a total order
- All thread see an SA in the same order.
- SA within a thread are in Program Order 
- SO is consistent: all reads in SO see the last writes in SO

## Synchronizes-With (SW) / Happens-Before (HB) Orders
- **SW** only **pairs** the **specific actions which "see" each other.**
- A volatile write to x synchronizes with subsequent read of x (subsequent in SO)
#### The **transitive closure** of PO and SW **forms HB**

**HB consistency**: When reading a variable, we see either the last write (in HB) or any other unordered write.
▪ This means races are allowed!

## Memory Operations
#Slides-Lecture-22 
#TODO Not sure if this belongs here (Including [[Java's Memory Model#Synchronization]] and [[Java's Memory Model#Real-World Hardware Memory]])

**Reminder**: Writing to memory is lazy by default (memory hierachy), instead, write to cache

**Recall:**
+ **Read** a memory location: Load data into cache
+ **Write** a memory location
	+ update cached copy
	+ lazily write cached data back to memory

"Flag violating" history is OK
+ processor delays writing to memory until after reads have been issued.

### Synchronization
#Slides-Lecture-22
#### Explicit
**Memory barrier instruction**
+ Flush unwritten caches
+ Bring caches up to date
Compilers often do this for you

**Implicit**
In Java: Ask compiler to keep variable up to date using [[Java's Memory Model#volatile fields|volatile]] (Also inhibits reordering, removing from loops & other optimizations)

### Real-World Hardware Memory
#Slides-Lecture-22 
**Weaker than [[Sequential Consistency]]**

But you can get sequential consistency at a price.

Concept of [[Linearizability]] more appropriate for high-level software.

> [!In short]
> [[Linearizability]] Good for high level objects
> 
> [[Sequential Consistency]] Goot way to think about hardware models
